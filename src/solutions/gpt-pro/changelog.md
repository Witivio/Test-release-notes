## Explanation:
I have used the same scenario described above and solved it as per my understanding. There can be other possible solutions also. My approach was to consider the brief explanation for introduction and keep an engaging tone while keeping the language of the notes simple and understandable. While writing the Bug Fixes and Enhancements sections, I tried to be as specific and concise as possible, using bullet points to make it easier for the user or reader. I added hyphens to the Bug Fixes and New Features lists to notify instantly the reader the category they are in. At the last, I added some sample responses that gave additional variety in the syntax used.
