# Any limits?

<p class="no-margin"><b>Understanding the Limits of Calendar Pro</b></p>

<p><b>Environment Specifics</b></p> 
<li><b>Exclusive to Microsoft Teams:</b> Calendar Pro is designed exclusively for integration within the Microsoft Teams environment, ensuring seamless collaboration within this platform.
Synchronization Limitations</li>
</br>


<li><b>External Calendar Import:</b> As part of our Platinum package, you can import up to 3 external calendars into your Calendar Pro. This limitation is to ensure optimal performance and user experience.</li>
<li><b>External Synchronization Constraints:</b> The process of syncing Calendar Pro with an external calendar is contingent on the external provider's update cycle.
This means that any new events added in Calendar Pro will appear in the external calendar based on their update schedule, which is not controlled by Calendar Pro. We recommend checking the synchronization frequency of your external calendar provider for better planning.</li>
</br>
<p>Note: These limitations are in place to maintain the highest standards of efficiency and reliability within the Calendar Pro app. For more detailed information or assistance, please refer to our support section or contact our helpdesk.</p>
