# Communication & Network Security

## Network diagram
In order to prepare your organization's network for Witivio solutions, here is an overview of the the different network flows involved:

### Flows between your organization's network and Witivio solutions

**All the traffic from and to the Witivio solutions use HTTPS protocol on port 443.**  
Here is a short description of each flow:
1. *.teams-pro.com / gpt-pro.com for the apps including help contents
2. *.msecnd.net and *..visualstudio.com for performance metrics analysis
3. *.windows.net for blob cache storage
4. *.microsoft.com for Microsoft Graph API access

## Traffic encryption

All the traffic from and to Witivio solutions are encrypted (and HTTPS protocol enforced), using [TLS v1.2](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices), ensuring secure communication between our customers and our platform. To do so, we’re using Azure Front Door as the only entry point to the app (web apps and API).

## DDoS prevention

While we've prevented rogue traffic from accessing our servers and network, it’s still possible for external services to block anyone else from using our service by creating a distributed, denial-of-service attack.  
To prevent this, we're using Azure Traffic Manager as a first level of protection.  
Learn more about [Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)

## Domains whitelisting

We understand that our customers need to be confident that they are communicating with Witivio solutions in a secure environment. Domains whitelisting is one of the most effective methods of ensuring this and prevents any internet traffic intended for Witivio from being hijacked or rerouted to a rogue website.  
Our complete portfolio of domains are outlined below to help our customers configure their corporate web proxy.

::: tip Note
This information is subject to change and we recommend that you check back quarterly for the addition of new domains.
