# How can I add tags to my events?

<p class="no-margin">Using tags to filter your events is a powerful way to personalize and streamline your Calendar Pro view. <br><br>This feature allows you to categorize your events based on different criteria such as project, team, or task type. <b>By adding tags, you can quickly and efficiently find the events that are most relevant to you, cutting through the clutter and enhancing your productivity.</b><br><br>For example, using tags to filter events such as your colleagues' holidays is a great way to keep track of who's in and out of the office.</p>
<p class="no-margin"><br>Click on the <b>Settings button ⚙️</b> next to the 'Month' button &gt; <b>select '🏷️ Tag management' (1)</b>. A new dialog will pop up.</p>
