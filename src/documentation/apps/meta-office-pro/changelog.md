## Release 05.09.23


### Backgrounds 

During this sprint, we worked on integrating Background cameras. You can now enjoy this feature from the settings. Use the Blur effect, your own wallpapers, or those shared by your team administrator. With this feature, there's no need to disable your camera during calls with colleagues for a more serene experience.


### Office 365 Status Synchronization

Your status on MetaOffice Pro is directly synchronized with your Office 365 environment. When you switch to "meeting" in your calendar, there's no need to change your availability in MetaOffice. Your status and activity are automatically updated. Your name now appears in green, red, and yellow based on your calendar. The "focus" mode is activated automatically.

### Focus mode 

We introduce the new "focus" button. It allows you to remain visible on MetaOffice but prevents other users from contacting you when they are right next to you. Activate or deactivate it throughout the day according to your preferences. Here are a few examples to better understand the use cases:

> - "I have a blocked slot in my calendar, I am marked as 'busy' on MetaOffice Pro, but I deactivate the 'Focus' mode, so anyone can come and talk to me!"

> - "I am available on my calendar, but I need concentration at the moment. I prefer my colleagues to send me a message before calling. I activate the Focus mode."

Feel free to adapt the language further to make it more user-friendly based on your target audience and the overall tone you want to convey.
