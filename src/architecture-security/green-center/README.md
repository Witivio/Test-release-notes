## Understanding the Green Center Deployment Model

### The Nature of Green Center: A Customized, Client-Hosted Solution

The Green Center, an innovative solution developed by Witivio, stands out from typical Software as a Service (SaaS) applications due to its unique deployment and operational model. Contrary to the standard SaaS framework, the Green Center is not a pre-packaged, cloud-based application hosted on Witivio's infrastructure. Instead, it represents a bespoke solution, intricately tailored to meet the specific requirements of each client.

::: tip Note
The Green Center is not a standard SaaS app; it is a customized solution developed specifically for each client's needs.
:::

### Customization Process: Tailoring to Client Specifications

The journey of implementing the Green Center begins with a detailed specifications phase. During this critical period, Witivio collaborates closely with the client to understand their unique needs and operational challenges. This collaborative approach ensures that the final product is not just a generic software application, but a solution that is intricately aligned with the client’s specific objectives and operational context.

::: tip Note
Customization is key - the Green Center is shaped and refined based on a thorough understanding of each client's specific requirements.
:::

### Hosting Model: Leveraging Microsoft Azure’s Capabilities

Once customized, the Green Center is deployed, not on Witivio’s servers, but within the client’s own Microsoft Azure subscription. This approach underscores a fundamental shift from the traditional SaaS model. By hosting the solution on their Azure environment, clients maintain complete control over their data and the application. This aspect is crucial for organizations prioritizing data sovereignty, compliance with regulatory requirements, and a higher degree of control over their software environments.

::: tip Note
Hosting on Microsoft Azure - Clients host the Green Center on their own Azure subscription, ensuring full control and data sovereignty.
:::

### Operational Responsibility: In the Client's Hands

A significant aspect of the Green Center's deployment model is the shift of operational responsibility to the client. Witivio does not oversee the run-time operations of the Green Center post-deployment. Instead, the client assumes full responsibility for the operation, management, and maintenance of the application within their Azure environment.

::: tip Note
Operational Control - Clients are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Green Center, ensuring autonomy and customization in its management.
:::

### Summary

In conclusion, the Green Center by Witivio is a paradigm shift from traditional SaaS applications. Its customization process, hosting on client's Microsoft Azure subscription, and the transfer of operational responsibilities to the client, all contribute to a model that prioritizes customization, control, and client-centricity. This model reflects a deep understanding of the diverse needs of modern organizations and Witivio's commitment to delivering solutions that are not just powerful but also profoundly aligned with each client's unique operational landscape.

We understand that our customers need to be confident using Green Center, and be aware of our data collection practices.

## Data Management Practices

Through the implementation of its different features, Green Center access, processes and stores several kind of data:

- Mail
- Personnal Onedrive
- User profile
- CO2 impact

Here is how we're managing data for these different categories:

| Data Type               | Accessed | Read | Downloaded | Cached | Stored | Backup | Deletion Policy | Notes |
|-------------------------|:--------:|:----:|:----------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:---------------:|-------|

| Personal OneDrive File  | ✔        | 🚫   | 🚫         | 🚫     | 🚫     | 🚫     | ✔               | Includes ID, creation/modification dates, filename, URL, size, parent folder, mimetype, drive type, site ID, and version list. |
| File Preview in Teams   | ✔        | ✔    | 🚫         | 🚫     | 🚫     | 🚫     | N/A             | Files previewed only in Teams, without server transfer or downloading. |
| Teams File              | 🚫       | 🚫   | 🚫         | 🚫     | 🚫     | 🚫     | N/A             | No access, reading, downloading, caching, or backup. |
| SharePoint File         | 🚫       | 🚫   | 🚫         | 🚫     | 🚫     | 🚫     | N/A             | No access, reading, downloading, caching, or backup. |
| User                    | ✔        | Partial| 🚫       | 🚫     | ✔      | 🚫     | ✔               | Includes AAD ID, score, carbon footprint, shared links count, and storage size. UPN and Name not accessed. |
| Shared File             | ✔        | 🚫   | 🚫         | ✔      | ✔      | 🚫     | ✔               | Access every 60 minutes for shared file count. Data is stored and cached. |
| User Profiles           | ✔        | ✔    | 🚫         | ✔      | ✔      | 🚫     | ✔               | Accessed and updated after each login. Stored as long as the organization is active. |

**CO2 Calculation:** The CO2 equivalent of Mega octets is configurable during the personalization phase.

**Deletion Policy:** Users can delete elements. A long-running process deletes items like mail and files.

## Architecture and flow diagram

![Green Center architecture](/assets/img/green-architecture.png)

The image depicts a flow diagram that illustrates the interaction between various components when a user starts an application within Microsoft Teams. Here is the described flow:

1. **User Interaction with Teams Application:**
   - The user initiates the application within Microsoft Teams, which is the starting point of the interaction.

2. **Identity Validation:**
   - Teams and Azure Active Directory (AAD) work together to validate the user's identity through Single Sign-On (SSO). This is a security measure to ensure that the user is who they claim to be.

3. **Information Retrieval via Microsoft Graph API:**
   - Once the user is authenticated, the application retrieves information about the authenticated user from the Microsoft Graph API, which is an interface that allows applications to access data within the Microsoft 365 platform.

4. **Application Rendering and Networking:**
   - The application is then rendered by the server, and network interactions occur through Azure's infrastructure. This includes Azure Front Door, which is a scalable and secure entry point for web applications, and a VNet, or virtual network, that provides isolation and routing for the application.

5. **Telemetry and Insights:**
   - Application Insights is utilized to gather runtime telemetry for error tracking and performance management, helping developers to monitor their applications and maintain service health.

6. **Secure Infrastructure Authentication:**
   - A user-assigned managed identity is used to authenticate against Azure services, allowing the application to access Azure resources securely without storing credentials in code.
