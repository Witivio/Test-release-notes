## Data Management Practices

Through the implementation of its different features, GPT Pro access, processes and stores several kind of data:

- Users data & chat
- Bot configuration
- File
- Plugins configuration

Here is how we're managing data for these different categories:
| Data | Accessed | Cached | Stored | Backup | Notes |
|------|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|-------|
| User profiles | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| Accessed and updated after each login.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| Bot Configuration | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| Accessed and updated after creation of a bot.<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| User data | ✔ | 🚫 | ✔ |🚫| Users data (AAD ID, UPN).<br/>Stored as long as the organization is active. |
| Bot conversations | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| Bot conversations.<br/>Accessed at each time the user connect to the bot. |
| Conversations history | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| Bot conversations history.<br/>Accessed at each time the user connect to the bot. |
| User feedbacks | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| User feedback about a bot message.<br/>Accessed when an admin coonect to the admin center. |
| Document files | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |🚫| Files for the KB of the bot.<br/>Accessed when the indexer vectorize the content. |
| Teams files | 🚫 | 🚫 | 🚫 |🚫| No access.<br/>No cache.<br/>No storage. |

## Microsoft Graph limits

In addition,Microsoft Graph apply another algorithm (token bucket) based on the complexity of the request. The maximum number of requests applies based [on the number of users in the tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling-limits#pattern).

All the limits are available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling-limits)
